We provide software consulting services with and around machine learning.  We are a small team of senior developers with
experience in:

* Machine Learning - specifically deep network creation and optimization.
* Ruby on Rails - We've been Ruby users for over a decade, and rails developers since 0.12.6 (2005).
* NodeJS - We are building hyperchamber with React and NodeJS.
* DevOps - We have experience creating and managing deployment strategies.  Most recently we have used docker containers 
  to distribute many apps on our own servers, distributed across many geographic locations.
