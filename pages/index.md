title: Machine learning and software development services
---

Machine learning is helping companies automate many tasks that were once deemed difficult or impossible.  We specialize
in building and optimizing deep neural networks.

## Web apps

We work with a large variety of technology.  We have been Ruby and Rails developers since before Rails was published.

We also have published apps written in Node and worked on machine learning projects in python.

## Open Source

Our open source projects speak for themselves - [check them out](/open-source/)
